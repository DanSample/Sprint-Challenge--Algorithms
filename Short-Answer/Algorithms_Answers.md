#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because no matter the input size it will run n times.

b) O(n log n) The first loop running is O(n). The second loop only runs when J is less than n. Its time
complexity is log(n).

c) O(n) because it will run "bunnies" amount of times recursively.

## Exercise II

Runtime O(log n)

Cut the number of floors in half, and then drop an egg to see if it breaks. Either remove the higher or lower values of n. You continue to do this until you find the right floor (f)
