#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because no matter the input size it will run n times.

b) O(n log n) The first loop running is O(n). The second loop only runs when J is less than n. Its time
complexity is log(n).

c) O(n) because it will run "bunnies" amount of times recursively.

## Exercise II
